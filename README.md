# Python Fundamentals & Advanced Concepts

This repository contains a collection of 10 Python scripts developed as part of my Python programming course. The projects range from basic logic and data structures to advanced topics like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Threading, and Web Scraping.

## 🚀 Projects Overview

Each script is designed to demonstrate specific Python features and libraries:

1. **Contact Management System**: CRUD operations using Dictionaries and JSON persistence.
2. **Text Analytics Tool**: Data processing using Lambda functions, Map, Filter, and Generators.
3. **Bank Account Simulator**: Advanced OOP concepts (Inheritance, Encapsulation) and Custom Exceptions.
4. **Web Price Tracker**: Web scraping with `BeautifulSoup` and error handling for network requests.
5. **Priority Task Manager**: Implementation of Stacks/Queues and custom Function Decorators.
6. **Secure Password Generator**: Usage of built-in modules like `secrets` and `string`.
7. **Auto-Clicker Bot**: Multithreading and Desktop Automation with `PyAutoGUI`.
8. **Market Data Visualizer**: Data visualization using `Matplotlib` and `NumPy`.
9. **Unit Converter Tool**: Logic implementation and conversion to executable via `Pyauto-to-exe`.
10. **Banking System Unit Tests**: Software testing suite using the `unittest` framework.

## 🛠️ Key Topics Covered

- **Functional Programming**: Lambda, Map, Filter, Reduce, Generators.
- **OOP**: Classes, Inheritance, Properties, Special Methods (`__init__`, `__str__`).
- **File I/O**: Working with TXT, CSV, and JSON files using Context Managers (`with`).
- **Error Handling**: Advanced `try-except-finally` blocks and Custom Exceptions.
- **Concurrency**: Introduction to Threading and Synchronization.
- **Automation & Scraping**: PyAutoGUI and BeautifulSoup.
- **Testing**: Unit Testing and Test Suites.
